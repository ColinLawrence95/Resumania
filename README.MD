## Game Description
Welcome to Resumania, a fast-paced action game where you take control of a resume trying to navigate the chaotic job market! Inspired by the classic Frogger, your mission is to dodge the perilous hazards of ATS bots, spam filters, and rejection letters while climbing up the grid towards the ultimate goal: landing an interview in the hiring manager's inbox!

Each time you successfully reach the top, you score an interview. But be warned, the challenges get tougher with each new level as the obstacles multiply and grow more aggressive. Will your resume have what it takes to make it past the filters and secure a coveted spot in the inbox, or will it be lost in the abyss of forgotten applications?

I created this game to bring a fun twist to the stressful and sometimes absurd world of job hunting. It's a lighthearted way to experience the hurdles of the application process, with a touch of nostalgia from classic arcade games.
